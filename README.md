## About the project
During my last year of high school, I was exploring the world of website development.
So, I used high school assignments as an opportunity to create websites and practice my skills.

This was one of websites created during that time. This project required a physical work to be submitted,
and I was (still am) interested in AR. So, I decided to create an educational AR website using AR.js.

I was still learning JavaScript, and this project helped me understand its syntax and usage better.
It also introduced me to libraries as well.
